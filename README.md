# Multi-SQL
#### Overview：

We develop the automatic multi-model database, Multi-SQL, which is specially designed for the automatic management of multi-model data, including automatic multi-model storage and index selection. The detailed demonstrations of Multi-SQL are available at the following video.

#### Environment Setting:

Python 3.7(or above)

MySQL 5.7 

Neo4j 3.5.14 

PostgreSQL 11.2 

Cassandra 3.11




#### Main Functions：

- **Database Creation** 

  Multi-SQL allows users to create their own multi-model database, and then create a variety of data objects in this library. After that, users can flexibly choose their own existing objects to operate, and constantly create new objects in the process.


- **Automatic Storage Selection for Multi-model Data**

  Given the multi-model data and workload, Multi-SQL automatically obtains proper storage structure by utilizing artificial intelligent methods embedded in Multi-SQL, which could improve the efficiency of multi-model database management.


- **Automatic Index Tuning for Multi-model Data**
  Multi-SQL could achieve automatic index selection for multi-model data. Given the data, workload and corresponding storage structure, Multi-SQL automatically completes index establishment in multi-model data without human tuning.

- **Query Execution**

  Based on the recommended storage structure and index configuration, users could implement multi-model query under different user selection configurations.
